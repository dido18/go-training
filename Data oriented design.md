Every problem you solve is a data problem.
Data tranformation is the core of everything we do (function, encapsulation, transofmration etc..)
Decoupling the data fro the algorithm to deal with data changes.

[[Mechanical sympathy]] is important, because when performance matters, the how the hardware works has to matter. 

We want to have algorithm tat are readable [[Readibility]] that work with data efficiently. 


Move from Object Oriented toward data-oriented design principles.
