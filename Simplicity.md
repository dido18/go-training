A code is simple if it hides the **complexity** (and it is readable [[Readibility]]  if it doesn't hide costs)

"Everything should be made simple as possible, but not simpler" (Albert Einstein)

For example, encapsulation of the methods. If having an encapsulation that is no longer understand the impact out code is having, we can't have it. 


 wanna make sure that these encapsulations are not just testable, I wanna make sure that they're providing 
 - a new semantic precise level of understanding 
 - that is not hiding cost
 - but hiding complexity
